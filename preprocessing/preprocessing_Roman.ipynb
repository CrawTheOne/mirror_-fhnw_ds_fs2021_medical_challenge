    "**Authors:** Roman Studer, Alexandre Rau\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** The goal of the Medical Challenge is the automated classification of the eye disease uveities. The goal is to find the best possible model for classifying the disease based on a data set of +1000 patients. Important features for the prediction are to be identified."

    "## Detailed Description\n",
    "The detailed description was taken from the job description on the [DS-Spaces website](https://ds-spaces.technik.fhnw.ch/medical-data-analysis-and-visualisation-fs/#menu-second) on 08/03/2021: \n",
    "\n",
    "In this international challenge, you will work in collaboration with Prof. Dr. Nida Şen (MD, MHS, Director of the Uveitis Clinic at the National Eye Institute, Washington DC) and her team, including Dr. Shilpa Kodati. Dr. David Kuo (MD, Biomed Eng.) of University of California, San Diego is also glad to support to project (in an asynchronous manner due to the large differences in time zones). You can listen to a 25-min podcast interview with Dr. Şen to get a first impression of her research agenda. Using real data obtained from 1075 patients with 55 markers (more  detailed description below), you will delve into computational methods for medical research to identify which markers are relevant for the diagnosis of uveitis, a common eye disease. \n",
    "\n",
    "**International and interdisciplinary** setting As the description above suggests, an exciting and challenging aspect of this challenge is in its interdisciplinarity and internationality. You will experience different academic cultures, professional roles/backgrounds and fully practice your English in a professional setting. The collaborative international work means several virtual meetings with our international partner and requires some flexibility due to time zones. These interactions will serve as an opportunity to practice and reflect on questions related to intercultural competence, i.e., intercultural communication and collaboration. Since it is a medical challenge you will also need to learn new terminology and communicate your ideas to a client of a different field.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Description of the disease**  Uveitis is a group of inflammatory diseases of the uveal tract of the eye. It is a sight-threatening autoimmune disease and it is responsible for approximately 10-15% of blindness. This disease has a real and sizable impact: Besides its life-changing negative implications for the individual, it also has consequences for the society, because it affects people in their most productive work years and thus leads to a socioeconomic burden. Uveitis is a multifactorial condition and its causes are not fully understood despite recent advances. Challenges in clinical uveitis research include disease heterogeneity, lack of understanding of what triggers and what propagates the disease. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Tasks\n",
    "Imagine that you are a part of a scientific team, working in the team’s data science unit. The above-mentioned dataset, already pre-processed & cleaned, is delivered to you with the following request: Using an exploratory (agnostic) data science and machine learning approach, analyze which of the variables might \n",
    "\n",
    "a) have strong correlations with each other, and with the diagnosed diseases of patients and patient groups\n",
    "\n",
    "b) lead to the identification (prediction) of the uveitis subtypes which may inform eventual diagnosis\n",
    "\n",
    "c) compare the HLA haplotypes in healthy controls to those in the project data, check if they correlate with specific subgroups. This will help verifying genetic predictors of certain subtypes of disease in this uveitis cohort. Data from healthy controls, i.e., normative data is publicly available as a separate data set (also see “Data” section below)\n",
    "\n",
    "d) analyze if the steps in the preprocessing could be improved\n",
    "\n",
    "e) which missing value strategy is best.\n",
    "\n",
    "We expect that you use a combination of exploratory data analysis (see competence ‘eda‘) probability testing, machine learning (see competences ule, sul) and visual analytics (see competence ‘van‘) to conduct your analyses. Using machine learning (ML), you will search for patterns and anomalies in the data, profile patients and/or patient groups (e.g., genetic profiles or patient history, their state vs. normative baseline data). Using visual analytics (VA) you will visualize/plot to demonstrate the relationships between variables and what ML detects using multiple linked views.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project management will be inspired in scrum. Code and artifacts should be documented in a git repository. After 1 or 2 weeks in the project a proposal of focus of the challenge group should be submitted to the challenge owners, preferably with a rough roadmap.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a data scientist, you will need to interpret and give context to your findings in order to enhance their value.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may also explore (optional) visualizing ML algorithm’s decisions (as a meta tool to make ML “understandable”). Such an analysis will facilitate the dialogue with the domain expert when analyzing which factor was (potentially) responsible for which impact. Note that understandable (explainable, interpretable) machine learning is a large and advanced topic. If you are curious about it, a good starting point maybe to learn about the decision tree concept: Decision Tree for starters is although fine: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qB8HZpwqPEg\n",
    "\n",
    "We will guide you both by providing you some materials from this space and guiding you to the relevant competences. When you have suggestions and questions, please use the “Stream” space, also answer each other’s questions, come to our sessions (see “timelines”), or when it is really needed, request appointments. Main tools for communication should be the “Stream” and the provided office hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach\n",
    "1. Exploratory data analysis (EDA)\n",
    "\n",
    "This inital step acts as the foundation of the project. By analyzing the data set, initial questions of understanding can be clarified and necessary steps for preparing the data set can be found. Strategies for imputation of missing, btw. wrong values are also considered here.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Data Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "In parallel with the EDA process, the first transformations of the data are carried out. This includes, for example, normalization and simplification of column names, adaptation of the data types of individual features and elimination of entry errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Feature extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "The data set is not in a \"Tidy Data\" state. This means that there are columns that contain more than one piece of information, i.e. more than one feature. Furthermore, columns exist that have values which should be transferred to more than one column. This step is necessary to prepare the dataset for a preprocessing pipeline that allows to transform the dataset for a machine learning model.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Preprocessing pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, the dataset was prepared in such a way that, with the support of the library sklearn.preprocessing, the dataset can be processed in such a way that a machine learning algorithm can work with it. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Setup modular environment to test multiple algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "By using the pipeline module of the sklearn library, we can build a modular environment that allows us to quickly apply and evaluate different machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Identify useful models\n",
    "\n",
    "Of the models tested, the most promising can be taken out. Through parameter optimization, these can be refined to achieve higher accuracy. \n",
    "\n",
    "7. Identify useful features\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the algorithm, the influence of a feature is identifiable. This influence of individual features can be checked or increased by various methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Document findings\n",
    "\n",
    "The insights gained will be recorded in a conference paper."
