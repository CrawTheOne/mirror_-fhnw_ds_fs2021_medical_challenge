# fhnw_ds_fs2021_medical_challenge

Medical Challenge

This repo is used for the Medical Data Analysis and Visualization project. The goal is to find important features for the prediction of the eye disease "uveitis" from a dataset with numerous features using supervised learning algorithms. Additional information is available on the website ds-spaces if you are working in the Data Science program at FHNW.

Instructions:

To run the notebooks in the folders ./machine_learning, ./data  and ./eda please place the files "uveitis_data.xlsx" and "uveitis_explanans.xlsx" into the ./data folder.
Without those files, the notebook will not produce any output.

All folders, except for ./administrative and './data' contain notebooks or scripts that will be used as a basis for the final paper.
The paper will be uploaded to this repo into the folder './report' on the 25th of June before 23:59:59:0000. 


Note: 
The documents in the folder './misc' stem from the last medical challenge and were used as reference. The files have been created by Riccard Nef in the HS20 semester.
